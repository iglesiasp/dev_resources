# dev_resources
There comes a time in the life of every developer in which adding new tabs to your browser isn't practical anymore.

After having accumulated dozens (more than a hundred and a half, actually) of open tabs in the various browsers that I have, some of which I have finally added to other tools like e.g. Pocket, I'm starting to realize this is not really a viable "read it later" method.

I also think that all these resources I've "collected" through time would be helpful to others, so in starting this repo I hope it will. I plan to keep it organized by categories (folders) so it doesn't become another painful and useless mess.

So, here I go, again on my own. Going down the only road I've ever known. Like a drifter I was born to walk alone, and I've made up my mind... I ain't wasting no more time.
